        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to personal data provided by clients of
          <strong>Infera-Block</strong> (hereinafter — the Company), both for the provision of various services
          (career consultations, resume audits, blog access) and for other interactions, typically in electronic
          format, as well as client participation in company promotions and technical support.
        </p>

        <p>
          Infera-Block reserves the right to make changes and additions to the current provisions of the Privacy Policy.
          Such changes and additions will take priority over the current provisions. Please note that the services
          provided may contain links to third parties that have their own Privacy Policy provisions. In such cases,
          the Company is not responsible for the content and compliance with the Privacy Policy of any third-party company.
        </p>

        <h2>Collection, Storage, and Destruction of Personal Data</h2>

        <p>
          Destruction, anonymization, or blocking of personal data (or parts thereof) is carried out to exclude the
