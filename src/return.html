          </li>
          <li>
            The service (consultation or resume audit) has already been fully rendered.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have viewed or downloaded more than 50% of the digital program materials, regardless of the time elapsed since the purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            The inability to complete training is due to technical problems on your side (lack of internet, incompatible software).
          </li>
        </ul>
